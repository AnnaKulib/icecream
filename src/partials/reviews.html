                <p>I think we all are Ice cream lovers and the best five Ice cream from my opinion are Cornetto: This is a frozen dessert
                    cone, the best flavor is Strawberry because it tastes like I'm eating Strawberry with some chocolate.
                    Vadilal: This brand is a little more expensive but the taste of these Icecreams is really good. Why not give this a try?
                    Mother's Dairy: The best option is the family pack Ice cream in this case. They are good at the taste and don't have ice
                    crystals in it.

            <p>I am not a big fan of sweets. But even then there are certain sweets that make me go gag a over them. I am very
            particular about these especially chocolates and Ice creams. I love those that are not too sweet. But I definitely do
            have a list of delicacies that render to my sweet tooth

                <p>Ice creams. They control us. They possess us. They clog our arteries and make our thighs and tummies bulge. Yet we love
                them, yet we eat them just for savouring a few moments of ecstasy. We know that they do no good, but all worries are
                forgotten when we lick the simply tantalizing and irresistible cream. At that time, we are blissfully unaware of the
                horrible consequences. THAT is the power of an ice cream.
