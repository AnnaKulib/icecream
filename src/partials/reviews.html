                    a frozen dessert cone, the best flavor is Strawberry because it tastes like I'm eating Strawberry with some chocolate.

                <p>I am not a big fan of sweets. But even then there are certain sweets that make me go gag a over them.
                    I am very particular about these especially chocolates and Ice creams. I love those that are not too sweet.

                <p>Ice creams. They control us. They possess us. They clog our arteries and make our thighs and tummies
                    bulge. Yet we love
                    them, yet we eat them just for savouring a few moments of ecstasy. We know that they do no good, but
                    all worries are
                    forgotten when we lick the simply tantalizing and irresistible cream.
